Address autocomplete and validation using the Postcode.eu API. Supports both Dutch and international addresses.

== Description ==

Postcode.eu Address validation provides address autocomplete and validation with an easy to implement API. The API offers addresses from several European countries, and more countries are constantly being added. We only work with official sources such as postal companies and governments to ensure high quality and accurate data that is up to date.

The Postcode.eu Address Validation plugin uses the Dutch Postcode API and International Address API to streamline the checkout process. By offering autocomplete suggestions for both Dutch and international addresses, it simplifies address input for customers. This functionality helps improve the accuracy of deliveries, reduce return rates due to incorrect addresses, and increase overall customer satisfaction. The result is a more efficient e-commerce operation with a higher conversion rate.
